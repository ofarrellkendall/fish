    "text": "The overarching goal of this study was to provide the O’ahu spearfisher a glimpse into the statistics behind their prey and their prey’s habitats. In other words, what can be pulled from data to shed light on where their desired fish species are found. To do so, The 2024 Hawai’i Reef Fish Survey data set from NOAA was used. The original aim was to compare the various environmental conditions data points (i.e. percent soft coral cover, hard coral cover, sponge cover, sand cover, clam cover, ect.) to fish species to determine if there were trends in what areas desirable fish species were observed. Unfortunately, when the dataset was paired down to observations strictly for O’ahu there were no data points for environmental conditions. So, the study pivoted to look at what data was available: Depth and Tropic group. The result culminated in the exploration of two main questions: Whether there is a significant difference in depth observed between tropic groups, and whether there is a significant difference in depth observed between species. These two questions are not independent as species determine tropic groups, but both hypothesis testing allows for results to be interpreted through two lenses that are important to the spearfisher because predators happen to taste better.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst the data set was made relevant to our study’s goal. It was paired down to include only observations from the island of O’ahu, then to observations only from to the shallow (0-6 m) and mid 6-18m) depth bins, and observations of edible fish species.  Once here, data exploration showed that only 9 species had enough observations (n&gt;/= 15) to hold up statistically. So, after the exploratory data visualization section, a further paired down data set with only the top 9 species was used. Certain species that are most relevant to the O’ahu Spearfisher, such as the much-coveted Kumu (Common name: Whitesaddle Goatfish), only had 2 observations and so were not able to be used in the analysis.\n\n\n\nGiven that tropic group is a categorical variable there were no two continuous variables to make linear regression models and search for correlations. So, histograms, an Anova test, and box plots were used to explore the relationship between depth and fish species, and depth and tropic group.\n\n\n\nDepth distributions of edible reef fish on Oʻahu vary significantly both among trophic groups and among commonly observed edible species which aligns with ecological knowledge.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, Spearfishers of O’ahu you are just one shallow water blackout from a tastier dinner!"
